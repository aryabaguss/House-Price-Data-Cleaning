# House Price Data Cleaning, EDA, and Predictive Modeling

A comprehensive project covering data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning modeling to predict house prices and identify key price determinants.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from raw data to predictive modeling:
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Machine learning modeling using Random Forest Regressor
4. Feature importance analysis

**Key Features:**
- Data quality assessment and preprocessing
- Interactive visualizations
- Price prediction modeling
- Feature importance evaluation
- Ready-to-use dataset for ML applications

## Key Steps Performed
